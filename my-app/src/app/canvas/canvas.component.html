      <h1> Canvas Redesign</h1>
      <p class="lead">Canvas is an educational management system that allows schools K-12 and universities to organize their classes so that students have access to class information and assignments, which are managed by staff. It provides features such as a discussion forum, inbox, calendar, and upcoming tasks for communication and convenience.

          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <h3>Description of Methods</h3>
          <p>Interviews</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The primary method used in this study was interviews. We aimed to interview participants of our target population: university students. Each of our group members contacted two university students whom we had connections with and requested a 30 minute to an hour time for interview. Interviews were conducted in a 2-to-1 format, where one person from the group was responsible for being the lead interviewer and another person was the notetaker, both interviewing the participant. Each interview started with the groups members giving the participants an interview consent form to agree and sign.             </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Survey</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The secondary method of research was gathering data through surveys. We created a survey based on our interview protocol, prompting similar types of responses. The survey was created on a Google Forum and posted on public, student-based pages on Facebook. The survey results provided the group with mostly quantitative data on the target population and their attitudes toward Canvas.              </li>

          <p> Although course information is displayed online for all to view, some information may still seem unclear. For those who would like to further ask question about course material, we found that the 89% would prefer asking other classmates for clarity, rather than asking in lecture, or sending an email to the professor or TA.             </p>

          <p>Students often have to find a way to juggle school, clubs, social activities, work, and much more. Results of our survey showcase that 67% of responders are involved in some form of extracurricular activity on campus with much of the information relayed through social media outlets such as Facebook and Instagram. When asked how were they able to keep track of their schedules and deadlines, there were numerous responses detailing that these students would much rather keep a mental note of short term tasks, whereas long term goals or activities were noted and stored for later. </p>

            <p class="lead">Working as a group              </p>
            <p>Working as a cohesive group is a critical skill that is learned and developed while in college. When asked about their experience working as a group, students who were surveyed and interviewed detailed the barriers they face when working as a team. The top three noted difficulties in working in a group involves aligning schedules with each others (60.7%), keeping communication (57.1%) and making decisions together (50%) shown on Figure 2.</p>

Although feedback is instantaneous when working in person as one interviewee noted, working online helps alleviate the difficulties of scheduling a time to meet all at once through the usage of collaboration tools like Google and chat applications.                 </p>

The top three tasks that these respondents use within canvas include checking their assignment, viewing course material, and viewing their grades. 26 out of the 28 (92.9%) respondents indicated that these the most used tasks on Canvas. When asked about a which particular tab that is most useful within Canvas, one interviewee indicated that the modules tab is “broken down by weeks which is very helpful” and that it also includes “the ability to view files all in one spot.”                 </p>

            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough: </h3>
            <p>For our cognitive walkthrough, all members of the group collaborated to go through a series of tasks in the system. At every task, we answered questions that focused on the visibility of elements and signifiers in the user interface and the interface’s effectiveness in communicating the purpose of those elements and the necessary actions required to accomplish each (sub)goal in the task. As a group we facilitated roles with one facilitator monitoring the course of the conversation, a scribe who took notes on the conversation, and participants who would discuss each task.               </p>
            <p>Tasks utilized in Cognitive Walkthrough:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Submit and write peer review comments</li>
              <li> Post on discussion board             </li>
              <li> Create a group </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Think Aloud Usability Test</h3>
            <p>Our think-aloud usability tests required actual participants, users (both regular and novices) of the system, to complete several tasks within the system, which took around 30 - 45 minutes. While progressing through the task, they were to explain their thought processing out loud. The facilitator would encourage the user to speak their thoughts while the notetaker would observe and record the user. After the user informed us that they were done, we would move on to the next task. Each user’s task was recorded via screen capture and timed.  Afterwards, they filled out the post-test questionnaire provided to measure their satisfaction of Canvas.              </p>
            <p> Task utilized in Usability Test              </p>

                  <p> Most users had difficulty accessing and conducting a peer review within Canvas. The average time it took our all of participants to finish the peer review lasted for 7:55 minutes. Although there is a tab that allows the ability to view peer reviews within the home page of the course, half the participants tried to locate the peer review by searching for this under the ‘Assignment’ tab. When users do decide to go onto the ‘assignment’ tab many utilized the Control-F feature to find the peer review. There is no distinction between which assignments are needed for peer review within the ‘Assignments’ tab.                    </p>

                  <p> None of our participants used the search bar titled “Search for Assignment” or the filter buttons of “Show by Date” or “Show by Type” shown on Figure 3. There is no adequate way to quickly search and select target items; often, users have to resort to scrolling through and scanning a long list of items. Most participants relied heavily on Command-F to find their target assignments after struggling to scroll up and down to search for their particular assignment.                     </p>

One user, a novice, after leaving the assignment page and frantically searching through other pages, asked why the rubric was “so tiny” when she finally found it.

                  <p> Participants struggled in finding how to access and navigate how to place comments within documents for peer review. Many had no problem recognizing the comment text box to the right, but for the participants who did not have experience with peer review, they did not realize that they could make comments directly on the document. When they were aware, they struggled to access the file. There is no clear control or signifier or anything that suggested that there was a way to directly access and utilize tools to comment on the file. Many incorrectly selected the link which would download a pdf of the peer’s file and would become confused as to how they would comment on the pdf. After some exploration/trial-and-error, they tried selecting “View Feedback” which provided them what they needed. The “View Feedback” control on Figure 6 is an inadequate control; it fails communicate that it is where users can click to provide feedback. A few participants brought up how the phrasing itself, “View Feedback”, was vague and one thought it was for viewing existing comments—not for actual editing/commenting.                     </p>

                  <p> When viewing documents on Canvas, the ability to access and work alongside these files is restricting as shown on Figure 7. Restricts users in only using the “+” and “-” to properly view the document in full resolution. Zooming in/out of the document with your mouse makes the document less pixelated and harder to read.The location to enter or exit full screen is not correctly positioned. Should be placed in the far right/left. Instead the mark tools are located there and can confuse user navigation. When peer reviewing it is difficult to view the  entire document and view the rubic since document window is limited in size.    </p>

                <p>Taking into consideration the fact that over half of our test participants searched for a separate peer review assignment instead of going back to the original assignment—where the assigned peer reviews were to be accessed from (shown below in Figure 9).  we suggest that the peer review feature be its own separate assignment (Figure 8a) with its own page  (Figure 8b) apart from the original assignment page where students submit their file(s) for the assignment. When the peer review assignment is selected from either the Assignments tab or the Home page Assignments section, it automatically leads to the Peer Review page (Figure 8b).                  </p>

This allows users to bypass the extra step of clicking the vague “View Feedback” or “Show Rubric” link because all such information or elements are already presented.  </p>
                  <p> The document under review will automatically be on display for the user, which would take up the width of the Canvas webpage (from the left sidebar to the far right-end of the page), without requiring the user to click the on document title, as needed in the original design. The assignment rubric (if available) will be on display in full at the bottom of the document. This is improving on the original design where the rubric is a small icon on the top with the text “Show Rubric”. This icon hides the rubric until it is clicked. The low visibility of the original rubric often makes it overlooked by students, contributing to the chances a student may perform an incomplete peer review without realizing it. </p>
                  <p> Whereas the original design often resulted in some users missing crucial steps in the peer review process, like filling out the rubric, this redesign concept puts all the necessary sections in the user’s view to encourage users to go through them before they get to the Submit button.</p>

                    <p> Within the usability testing, a few of the test participants mentioned that  they did not understand the purpose behind the Dashboard and the difference between that page/tab and the Courses tab. There was also confusion about the presence of nested, or another level of navigation “contained in” and underneath the main navigation (this level deals with more course-specific pages - shown in Figure 20). Some tabs on the navigation bar were for pages or functionalities that involved cross-course information whereas others only were for course-specific information. Because a lot of our participants (interviewees and test participants) explained that they primarily focus on navigating between their courses, and do not visit other tabs on the navigation, we decided to narrow down the main navigation to focus on the courses themselves.                       </p>

                          <p> Feedback from user research participants and other users in the presentation of our progress presentation mentioned the lack of consistency and standardization throughout the system and more specifically the home page. Two of our interviewees mentioned how they liked how some of their courses had a module layout, wherein resources and assignments for the course are organized by week. Taking this into consideration, as well as user research results which revealed that students mainly go on Canvas to look for resources, we have decided that the home page should features a module-like layout. and The fact that students organize their schedules by weeks (mostly college students) further supports the organization of a week-by-week schedule. When users open up this page, the interface reveals the current week and all relevant resources, such as lecture slides, assignments, and readings. Users can navigate by week via the arrows above and below. A filter feature can be accessed in the right-hand corner for other filtering and layout organization settings to offer more flexity in view (Figure 21).                            </p>

                      <p class="lead">Overall, our redesign should significantly improve the clarity of work flow in the peer review process. Novice users will experience a more friendly editing page, where they will no longer have to click certain things in order to view the document being peer reviewed or the rubric. Users will be able to be certain that the requirements have all been met in order for assignments to be considered as complete with the “Submit” button as the last step of the process. Signifiers have been improved to provide more visibility and awareness to the user. The discussion section has been redesigned to promote more conversation, with the response text box already opened so that the user can immediately begin his or her response. It also distinguishes the instructor’s responses and students’ responses, and is rearranged in the way that assignments are prioritized over other discussion. Our new Home Page has been redesigned to cater to how students think over the course of the different quarters, so that it shows course material on a weekly basis rather than by specific dates.
