                <h5><span class="text-muted">Description of Methods.</span></h5>
                <p> <strong> Interviews </strong> </p>
                 <p class="li"> The primary method used in this study was interviews. We aimed to interview participants of our target population: university students. Each of our group members contacted two university students whom we had connections with and requested a 30 minute to an hour time for interview. Interviews were conducted in a 2-to-1 format, where one person from the group was responsible for being the lead interviewer and another person was the notetaker, both interviewing the participant. Each interview started with the groups members giving the participants an interview consent form to agree and sign. Then the lead interviewer proceeded with the interview protocol, and the designated note taker recorded the answers of the interviewee on a typed document. Due to conflicting schedules some interviews were done on a 1 to 1 format, with an moderator both asking questions and taking note of answers. 
                <p> <strong>Surveys</strong> </p>
                 <p class="li">The secondary method of research was gathering data through surveys. We created a survey based on our interview protocol, prompting similar types of responses. The survey was created on a Google Forum and posted on public, student-based pages on Facebook. The survey results provided the group with mostly quantitative data on the target population and their attitudes toward Canvas.

                    <ul class="bulletStyle"><li> Although course information is displayed online for all to view, some information may still seem unclear. For those who would like to further ask question about course material, we found that the 89% would prefer asking other classmates for clarity, rather than asking in lecture, or sending an email to the professor or TA.

                    <ul class="bulletStyle"> <li> Students often have to find a way to juggle school, clubs, social activities, work, and much more. Results of our survey showcase that 67% of responders are involved in some form of extracurricular activity on campus with much of the information relayed through social media outlets such as Facebook and Instagram. When asked how were they able to keep track of their schedules and deadlines, there were numerous responses detailing that these students would much rather keep a mental note of short term tasks, whereas long term goals or activities were noted and stored for later.

                    <ul class="bulletStyle"> <li>Working as a cohesive group is a critical skill that is learned and developed while in college. When asked about their experience working as a group, students who were surveyed and interviewed detailed the barriers they face when working as a team. The top three noted difficulties in working in a group involves aligning schedules with each others (60.7%), keeping communication (57.1%) and making decisions together (50%) shown on Figure 2.

                    <ul class="bulletStyle"> <li>When working as a group, interviewees do not mind either collaborating in-person on online, as long as progress is being made. Although feedback is instantaneous when working in person as one interviewee noted, working online helps alleviate the difficulties of scheduling a time to meet all at once through the usage of collaboration tools like Google and chat applications.

                    <ul class="bulletStyle"> <li> When asked about Canvas itself, the survey indicates that 64.3% of respondents use Canvas 1-5 times a day. The top three tasks that these respondents use within canvas include checking their assignment, viewing course material, and viewing their grades. 26 out of the 28 (92.9%) respondents indicated that these the most used tasks on Canvas. When asked about a which particular tab that is most useful within Canvas, one interviewee indicated that the modules tab is “broken down by weeks which is very helpful” and that it also includes “the ability to view files all in one spot.”

One interviewee detailed that the feature “was confusing on how you inputted your comment and making sure that it send through” as well as “accessing their work”. Another explained that “you are only restricted in viewing in under the canvas display which can be annoying.” In addition, our respondents felt that they felt that their canvas experience could be maximized if they were able to learn and experience other unused features such as the Inbox, Calendar, and Groups tabs.

                    <ul class="bulletStyle"> <li> For our cognitive walkthrough, all members of the group collaborated to go through a series of tasks in the system. At every task, we answered questions that focused on the visibility of elements and signifiers in the user interface and the interface’s effectiveness in communicating the purpose of those elements and the necessary actions required to accomplish each (sub)goal in the task. As a group we facilitated roles with one facilitator monitoring the course of the conversation, a scribe who took notes on the conversation, and participants who would discuss each task.

While progressing through the task, they were to explain their thought processing out loud. The facilitator would encourage the user to speak their thoughts while the notetaker would observe and record the user. After the user informed us that they were done, we would move on to the next task. Each user’s task was recorded via screen capture and timed.  Afterwards, they filled out the post-test questionnaire provided to measure their satisfaction of Canvas.

This could be due to the fact that the contents/icons in the legend are in a gray color which fails to stand out among the other icons which were in the same color as all of the fonts on the same page. One participants mentioned that it would help if the legend stood out through color. Another area where the treatment of the element caused an issue, though minor and not as common, is the Reply button on the discussion post. It took a bit longer for some people to notice the Reply button and through our evaluation, we found that the Reply Button did not stand out due to the fact that it was the same color as the background and did not physically look like a clickable button.

This is improving on the original design where the rubric is a small icon on the top with the text “Show Rubric”. This icon hides the rubric until it is clicked.

For our redesign, instead of having to click “Reply,” a response is encouraged by already having the text box shown on the page (Figure 18).

Answers endorsed by the instructor will be marked with a yellow/gold seal labeled “instructor approved” and the instructor’s name is in a yellow color font to help users distinguish instructor interaction from student interaction. A more interactive and responsive discussion section will ease the search for particular responses. Indentations to communicated responses to original responses are better visualized by the addition a blue line, helping users group together certain response threads and distinguish others (Figure 19).

There was also confusion about the presence of nested, or another level of navigation “contained in” and underneath the main navigation (this level deals with more course-specific pages - shown in Figure 20). Some tabs on the navigation bar were for pages or functionalities that involved cross-course information whereas others only were for course-specific information. Because a lot of our participants (interviewees and test participants) explained that they primarily focus on navigating between their courses, and do not visit other tabs on the navigation, we decided to narrow down the main navigation to focus on the courses themselves.

                      <ul class="bulletStyle"> <li> Feedback from user research participants and other users in the presentation of our progress presentation mentioned the lack of consistency and standardization throughout the system and more specifically the home page. Two of our interviewees mentioned how they liked how some of their courses had a module layout, wherein resources and assignments for the course are organized by week. Taking this into consideration, as well as user research results which revealed that students mainly go on Canvas to look for resources, we have decided that the home page should features a module-like layout. and The fact that students organize their schedules by weeks (mostly college students) further supports the organization of a week-by-week schedule. When users open up this page, the interface reveals the current week and all relevant resources, such as lecture slides, assignments, and readings. Users can navigate by week via the arrows above and below. A filter feature can be accessed in the right-hand corner for other filtering and layout organization settings to offer more flexity in view (Figure 21).

Novice users will experience a more friendly editing page, where they will no longer have to click certain things in order to view the document being peer reviewed or the rubric. Users will be able to be certain that the requirements have all been met in order for assignments to be considered as complete with the “Submit” button as the last step of the process. Signifiers have been improved to provide more visibility and awareness to the user. The discussion section has been redesigned to promote more conversation, with the response text box already opened so that the user can immediately begin his or her response. It also distinguishes the instructor’s responses and students’ responses, and is rearranged in the way that assignments are prioritized over other discussion. Our new Home Page has been redesigned to cater to how students think over the course of the different quarters, so that it shows course material on a weekly basis rather than by specific dates.

                      <p class="li"> With consideration of other feedback, which brought up concerns with the redesign of the navigation page, we want to bring up other suggestions to address recent feedback. By focusing on the student view within this study, we did not consider the instructor view. Changes to the student view will inevitably affect the instructor view/experience of the system. In regards to the navigation bar, we have decided that, rather than taking out the cross-course features like Calendar and Inbox (both of which are important in the instructor view and experience), that there should be a division of navigation: one for course-specific features and pages and one relating to the user’s account. The user navigation would include both Calendar and Inbox as these vary among users. These pages should be accessible through the Accounts navigation. By separating navigation between a course-related navigation hierarchy bar, and a user/account-related navigation, we will be addressing any confusion about the purpose behind the individual navigation tabs.
