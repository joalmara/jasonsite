                    <div class="subheading mb-3"> Looking to bring people together to create a network of support and be committed to the wellness of inidivdual by implementing effective mental health and social-emotional consultation in a safe and confidential environment
                      </div>
                    <p>Our primary goal as a team was to find ways to build a network of support and a sense of belonging for individuals who are looking to tackle issues together in a non-intimidating and safe space. To do this, our team looked to design and build a mobile application in which users can schedule group therapy sessions through virtual reality. Users can take a free screening test - from the mental health america - with topics such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc to get feedback based on their answers from a questionnaire. Whichever results the users receive, the application will recommend different sessions in which they can enroll onto. Individuals can choose whichever sessions are convenient for them and determine the times in which they can join. Each session will be proctored by a trained psychiatrist who will guide conversation about whichever topic that is being discussed. The actual virtual reality session will then actually be utilized by a separate application known as vTime which supports group VR session through a mobile device. Users will have the option to choose their screen name and display the way look through the vTime application. In addition, each member must comply with the code of conduct that are set in place before joining a session, detailing the proper way of conversing within a group. Within these sessions individuals will meet to solve any problems, achieve any personal goals, track their emotions, improve communication and social skills and build the life they deserve. </p>

                    <p>We primarily would target adults from ages 20 to 30 years who seem to be dealing with any type of anxiety of trauma in their lives. Usually individuals in these stages of their lives deal with a considerable amount of stress due to may of life’s changes in dealing with expenses, education, romance and career oriented goals. A study done at the Center on Healthy Aging at the University of California, San Diego detailed that those that are older seemed to be satisfied with their mental health, whereas those who are in their 20s and 30s reported to have much more exposure towards higher levels of stress, depression and anxiety. In addition, the individuals who within the ages of 20 and 30s are more likely to be comfortable using new and progressive technologies to improve their wellness and we speculated that this age group would likely consider using VR technology.</p>

                        <p>We felt that if we exposed this application within already established therapy location, we could adopt users who are already using group therapy as a way to deal with their issues. This would be viewed as another alternative to help express their concerns in a much more convenient fashion than physically going to a seminar. In this day and age, it is also important to have a social media presence to help get good exposure to your brand and application to reach as many people as possible. </p>

                    <p>This application will give users the flexibility to schedule group therapy sessions within the times they are most available and to their choosing. Individuals no longer have to dedicate time to physically locate and determine which psychiatrist will be best for them, rather they can use this application to browse the different type of sessions that are offered. In addition, users can get a understanding of how the application is used given their ability to freely use it for the first 30 days.</p>
                    <p> Those that enter actual group therapy may feel uncomfortable sharing their thoughts and emotions with others and are unsure what type of reactions they will receive. The way in which this application looks to relive this issue is by allowing users to create their own avatars of themselves through vTime and allow them to set their own screen name so that their likeness will not be publicized. Those who may feel embarrassed who go to traditional group therapy sessions will be given the freedom to share their thoughts in a non-judgemental environment with sessions being proctored by a trained psychiatrist. If one feels that another individual is disruptive or disrespectful, the psychiatrist has the ability to “kick” and “block” another person to maintain the safe space.                </p>

All of this data was analyzed using categorical data. We looked at question and looked at which answer got the highest percentage for responses. Whichever answer got the highest response was what we came to for our conclusion for the question.

We gathered several individuals who were close to the target audience and asked them to perform certain tasks within the application. We observed and analyzed the way they accomplished these tasks and then followed up with a basic questionnaire on their experience performing those tasks.

Any issues that the individuals had, we would write down as potential needed improvements. In regards to what we found, we discovered issues with regards to enrolling in a session. What we found was that people expected enrollment to be available anywhere that the sessions were viewable. Furthermore we found that some people expected the appointments to be in profile instead of the calendar section.

It will solve mental health issues for people with age from 20 to 30 by providing a virtual space for group therapy sessions. A way in which we can know that we accomplished this goal would be having a solid number of daily and active unique users making appointments and scheduling sessions through our mobile application. We will also look at which ways this application looks to improve the lives of others through future study of customer behavior using the application.

                                      <p> Since the application was developed on a web based framework of Ionic and Angular, we were at first designing the application to fit the purposes of looking like a website. However after introducing it to several individuals looking to test it, they felt that the application should be more mobile friendly. Suggestions included having larger buttons so that users can easily tap the selection they made on their mobile device and proceed with their tasks. We also placed buttons where users expect to find them such as in the bottom right corner when filling out a form and or highlighting areas in which places individuals can touch on. In addition, some of the individuals in which we tested with detailed that the text could be more readable. As a team we decided to increase font sizes of the text and added color in spots which were necessary such as titles of pages and on buttons. 
                                      </p> 
                                        <p>Another valuable piece of information that we got from our testing was clarifying the process of going into a virtual reality session and how that would play out. Initially we wanted the idea of the app in which we can load the virtual realty sessions within our product MVP, but realized that was some constraints in terms of implementation that would not make it feasible within the 3 months time span that we had. A solution that we gartnered as a team was instead using an already pre-existing application known as vTime to assist in generating the virtual reality sessions. This information is conveyed once users officially enroll into a course of their choosing. Users of our initially testing was confused of how the virtual reality sessions will actually be presented and questioned whether it would be on our mobile application itself. So as a team we decided to introduce instructional sliders which break down the process of how to go into the virtual reality session. However, ideally for our next iteration we would like this feature to be within our mobile application itself. Users would get a push notification of when their session will start and would then load up their session once ready. 
                                        </p>
                                          <p>As a team we also got some feedback on how this application could be used as a more intimately and help build relationships As a team we also got some feedback on how this application could be used as a more intimately and help build relationships

                                              <h2 class="mb-5"> Conclusion          </h2>
                                          <p> For the time being most of our application is based on the user’s side of the application and how they can enroll into group therapy sessions, but from our user testing it would also be valuable to develop how the application will be viewed in terms of the proctor’s point of view. Details like classes being taught, students enrolled, and class details will be useful for proctors to help monitor each session.
                                          </p>
                                            <p> Additionally, we will look to incorporate more user testing within our development process to get valuable feedback on what is desired and how it will be used. This would include doing usability testing specifically for the proctors and get feedback on whether this idea is feasible or desirable. We felt that we could have spent much more considerable time in interviewing trained counselors and or psychiatrist to get feedback on whether this application could provide value in their workspace.                                                 </p>
                                            <p>In addition, we will also hopefully bring a tighter integration on vTime and the process of loading up a virtual reality session. vTime’s user experience is not fully fleshed out and we would like our users to easily load into a session without providing complications. Essentially adding more of a detailed documentation of what it means to load into a session. However, at the time there is no readily available vTime API integration which may constrain our development. Adding a feature which can document  features of vTime within our MVP would also provide dividends in explaining how the VR sessions can be joined. In the future we will hope to ingrain also a better collaboration between design and implementation so that aesthetically the application could be much more user friendly. 
                                            </p>
